# Salaam Anam,
# Good to see your code via github. Hope you are enjoying it.
# A few CONVENTIONS to follow while programming in C:
# A file name is usually in small letters
# All the local variables should start from lower letters
# All the constants should be in CAPTIALS
# All the declarations should be in .h file and its definitions should be in .c file. I will explain the role of .h as we proceed. But for now, have all declarations in .h file.
# Make sure the code in always indented. Improves the readability
# Every file should have a multi line comment explaining what the file does.
# Avoid using literals like 2 or 5 in the program. Use #define to do so, read can understand quite easily.
# Use meaning names while naming a variable.
# Please let me know if you have anything is not clear above?

# I will let you know of more conventions as we proceed.
# I have improved this program to next level and put forward a few questions. Please read the C file
